  In 2014, the then mayor of Barcelona challenged cities to produce everything
  they consume by 2054. The Fab City Global Initiative supports this shift from
  a Product-in Trash-out to a Data-in Data-out urban model. It comprises a <a
  class="underlined-blue page-scroll" href="#global-initiative">Network</a> of
  28 cities, a <a class="underlined-blue page-scroll"
  href="#fab-city-collective">core group of Collective members</a> and is
  governed by a foundation. With the support of a global community, it works to
  change the urban paradigm of yesterday, and make the cities of tomorrow,
  today.
