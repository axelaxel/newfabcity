  Fab City Global Initiative challenges the current industrial paradigm of
  Product-in Trash-out, by advocating for the return of manufacture to cities
  supported by a Data-in Data-out urban model. It  comprises a <a
  class="underlined-blue page-scroll" href="#global-initiative">network</a> of
  28 cities, a <a class="underlined-blue page-scroll"
  href="#fab-city-collective">core team of collective members</a> and is
  governed by a foundation, all working to change the urban paradigm of
  yesterday, and make the cities of tomorrow.
