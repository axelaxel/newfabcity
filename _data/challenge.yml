  In 2014, the then mayor of Barcelona presented the challenge for cities to
  produce everything they consume by 2054. The Fab City Global Initiative
  developed to support this long-term goal, through short-term initiatives. The
  shift from Product-in Trash-out to Data-in Data-out is enabled by a <a
  class="underlined-blue page-scroll" href="#global-initiative">network</a> of
  28 cities, a <a class="underlined-blue page-scroll"
  href="#fab-city-collective">the advocacy of the core Collective members</a>
  and the governance of a foundation; with the collective vision to change the
  urban paradigm of yesterday, and make the cities of tomorrow.
